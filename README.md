# Archival Tibia 7.1 Login Server
Written as part of a bigger project to learn more about the Tibia 7.1 client, mostly for fun, archival purposes and nostalgia.

⚠ **Disclaimer:** Severely lacking in error handling and security, it is still a work in progress and it is very unlikely that it will ever handle malicious packets, as this project is not intended to be used to host a private Tibia 7.1 server publicly.

Info about file structures can currently only be found by going through the code, when I have the time I will create a wiki and add them there.

⚠ **Note:** This is only the login server, the world server will be found in [ArchivalTibiaV71WorldServer](https://github.com/Szune/ArchivalTibiaV71WorldServer).
